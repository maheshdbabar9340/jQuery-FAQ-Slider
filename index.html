				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> Enumerate the differences between Java and JavaScript?</li>
				<li class="a">Java is a complete programming language. In contrast, JavaScript is a coded program that can be introduced to HTML pages.

				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> What is the use of isNaN function?</li>
				<li class="a">isNan function returns true if the argument is not a number otherwise it is false.</li>
				
				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> Between JavaScript and an ASP script, which is faster?</li>
				<li class="a">
					JavaScript is faster. JavaScript is a client-side language and thus it does not need the assistance of the web server to execute. On the other hand, ASP is a server-side language and hence is always slower than JavaScript. Javascript now is also a server side language (nodejs).</li>
